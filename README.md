Asset Export (for iOS, Android & Web)
=======================================

A plugin for Sketch to export layers for iOS, Android & Web. Supports transparency, 1x base size, and has been tested against Sketch 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5

TIP: If everything is exporting as a solid rectangle, you probably need to select the artboard and UNCHECK "Include in Export" (in reference to the background color).

#### How to Install
Install [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/) and search for 'Asset Export for iOS and Android'.
