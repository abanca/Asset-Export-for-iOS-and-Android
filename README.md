Asset Export (for iOS & Android)
=======================================

A plugin for Sketch to export layers for Android & iOS. Supports transparency, 1x base size, and has been tested against Sketch 3.2, 3.3, 3.4

TIP: If everything is exporting as a solid rectangle, you probably need to select the artboard and UNCHECK "Include in Export" (in reference to the background color).
